#the following rules:
#

# - Shows should be released on Wednesdays or Sundays.
# - Movies should be released on Fridays.
# - Plays should be released on Saturdays.

#valid, False if it's not.

#The date will be an instance of Python's date class. If
#you have an instance of date called a_date, you can

#a_date.weekday(). a_date.weekday() will return 0 if the
#day is Monday, 1 if it's Tuesday, 2 if it's Wednesday,
#up to 6 if it's Sunday.

#If the type of release is not one of these strings,

JoynerConjecture:

#The Joyner Conjecture is a not-at-all famous mathematical
#series inspired by the Collatz Conjecture for use in this
#class.
#
#The Joyner Conjecture proceeds as follows:
#
#Start with any number. If the number is divisible by 3,
#divide it by 3. Otherwise, add 2 to the number. Eventually,
#no matter what number you begin with, this series will run
#into 1 or 2. If it runs into 1, it will repeat 1-3 forever.
#If it runs into 2, it will repeat 2-4-6 forever.
#
#For example, imagine we started with the number 5:
#5 is not divisible by 3, so 5 + 2 = 7
#7 is not divisible by 3, so 7 + 2 = 9
#9 is divisible by 3, so 9 / 3 = 3
#3 is divisible by 3, so 3 / 3 = 1
#
#Start with 5, this sequence converges on 1 in 4 iterations:
#5 -> 7, 7 -> 9, 9 -> 3, 3 -> 1.
#
#Write a function called joyner. joyner should have one
#parameter, an integer. It should return the number of
#iterations required to reach either 1 or 2 for the first
#time.


#Add your code here!
def joyner(number):
    count = 0
    while number != 1:
        if number % 3 == 0:
            number /= 3
            count +=1
        else:
            number += 2
            count += 1
    return count
