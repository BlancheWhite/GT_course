Introduction to Computing course CS1301 at Georgia Tech available on edx.org

Below is the breakdown of how the 19 chapters split into the 4 Professional Certificate courses:

CS1301xI: Computing in Python I: Fundamentals and Procedural Programming - Units 1 and 2 (Chapters 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4)
CS1301xII: Computing in Python II: Control Structures - Unit 3 (Chapters 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5)
CS1301xIII: Computing in Python III: Data Structures - Unit 4 (Chapters 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5)
CS1301xIV: Computing in Python IV: Objects & Algorithms - Unit 5 (Chapters 5.1, 5.2)

CS1301xI is the first in a four-course called Introduction to Computing. This particular course will cover:
- the basics of computing and procedural programming, including mathematical, relational, and logical operators, variables and
- variable types, and the basics of style and commenting.
This course covers Units 1 and 2 from Georgia Tech's CS1301 class. You'll notice our numbering scheme references this: Chapters 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 comprise Unit 1; Chapters 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4 comprise Unit 2; and all seven of these chapters together comprise CS1301xI.

CS1301xII is the second in a four-course called Introduction to Computing. This particular course will cover:
- control structures: conditionals, 
- for loops, 
- while loops, 
- functions, 
- error handling. 
This course covers Unit 3 from Georgia Tech's CS1301 class. You'll notice our numbering scheme references this: Chapters 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, and 3.5 comprise Unit 3, and Unit 3 forms the entirety of CS1301xII.

CS1301xIII is the third in a four-course Professional Certificate called Introduction to Computing. This particular course will cover:
- data structures: strings, 
- lists, tuples, 
- files, 
- and dictionaries. 
This course covers Unit 4 from Georgia Tech's CS1301 class. You'll notice our numbering scheme references this: Chapters 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, and 4.5 comprise Unit 4, and Unit 4 forms the entirety of CS1301xIII.

CS1301xIV is the fourth and final in a four-course Professional Certificate called Introduction to Computing. This particular course will cover:
- objects and algorithms: object-oriented programming, 
- Big O notation, 
- recursion, 
- sorting algorithms, 
- and search algorithms. 
This course covers Unit 5 from Georgia Tech's CS1301 class. You'll notice our numbering scheme references this: Chapters 5.1 and 5.2comprise Unit 5, and Unit 5 forms the entirety of CS1301xIV.
