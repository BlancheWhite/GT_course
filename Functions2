Sevens:

#Write a function called lucky_sevens that takes in one
#parameter, a string variable named a_string. Your function
#should return True if there are exactly three '7's in
#a_string. If there are less than three or more than three
#'7's, the function should return False.
#
#For example:
#  - lucky_sevens("happy777bday") should return True.
#  - lucky_sevens("h7app7ybd7ay") should also return True.
#  - lucky_sevens("happy77bday") should return False.
#  - lucky_sevens("h777appy777bday") should also return False.
#
#Hint: Remember in Chapter 3.3, we covered how to use a loop
#to look at each character in a string.


#Write your function here!

IdealGasLaw:

#Last problem, we wrote a function that calculated pressure
#given number of moles, temperature, and volume. We told you
#to assume a value of 0.082057 for R. This value means that
#pressure must be given in atm, or atmospheres, one of the
#common units of measurement for pressure.
#
#atm is the most common unit for pressure, but there are
#others: mmHg, Torr, Pa, kPa, bar, and mb, for example. what
#if pressure was sent in using one of these units? Our
#calculation would be wrong!
#
#So, we want to *assume* that pressure is in atm (and thus,
#that R should be 0.082057), but we want to let the person
#calling our function change that if need be. So, revise
#your find_pressure function so that R is a keyword parameter.
#Its default value should be 0.082057, but the person calling
#the function can override that. The name of the parameter for
#the gas constant must be R for this to work.
#
#As a reminder, you're writing a function that calculates:
#
# P = (nRT) / V
#


#Write your function here! You may copy your work from 3.4.5
#if you'd like.
def find_pressure(moles, temperature, volume, R = 0.082057):

#Below are some lines of code that will test your function.

#Write a function called is_a_contender that will take three

#
#Based on these parameters, the function should return one
#of three strings:
#
# - If the team is a contender (at least 40 wins and fewer
#   than 20 losses), return "The [team name] are a contender!"
# - If the team is not a contender (less than 40 wins and at least
#   20 losses), return "The [team name] are not a contender!"

#
#You should assume that if a combined blood pressure is on the
#line between two categories (e.g. 80 and 60, or 120 and 70),
#the result should be the higher category (e.g. Ideal and
#Pre-high for those two combinations).
#
#HINT: Don't overcomplicate this! Think carefully about in

#problem could be easy or extremely hard depending on the
#order you change and whether you use returns or elifs wisely.

PokemonDamage2:

#Recall Coding Problem 2.4.4. In that problem, you calculated
#the damage done by an attack based on several parameters.
#
#Convert your code from there into two functions, one called
#calculate_damage and one called calculate_modifier.

#Your function for calculate_damage must call calculate_modifier;
#it may not calculate the modifier separately. As such,
#calculate_damage should accept all ten parameters: STAB,
#Type, Critical, Other, Random, Level, Attack, Defense, and
#Base. You'll need to pass STAB, Type, Critical, Other, and
#Random to calculate_modifier.
#
#Make sure the parameters to each function follow the order
#shown above.
#
#As a reminder, damage is calculated using this formula:
#courses.edx.org/asset-v1:GTx+CS1301xII+1T2018+type@asset+block@DamageCalc.png

AverageWordLength:

#-----------------------------------------------------------
#In this problem, you should write three functions:
#word_count, letter_count, and average_word_length.
#
#word_count should take as input a string. It should return
#the number of words in the string. You may assume that the
#number of words in the string will be one more than the
#number of spaces in the string.
#
#letter_count should take as input a string. It should return
#the number of letters in the string. You may assume that
#the string is only letters and spaces: no punctuation or
#numbers.
#
#average_word_length should take as input a string. It should
#return the average length of the words in the string. You
#can find the average length by dividing the number of letters
#by the number of words.
#
#Your implementation for average_word_length *must* call
#word_count and letter_count.


#Add your code here!

ValidCharacters:

#there are no non-numerals (although we might accept dashes
#or spaces). When asking for a name, we want to make sure
#all the characters are letters, spaces, or the occasional
#punctuation mark.
#
#Write a function called is_valid. is_valid should take two
#parameters: a string to check, and a string of all valid
#characters.
#
#is_valid should return the boolean True if all the
#characters in the string to check are present in the string
#of valid characters. It should return False if any character
#in the checked string does not appear.


#Add your code here!

VowelsAndConsonants:

#Call this function count_letters. It should have two
#parameters: the string in which to search, and a boolean
#called find_consonants. If find_consonants is True, then the
#function should count consonants. If it's False, then it
#should instead count vowels.
#
#Return the number of vowels or consonants in the string
#depending on the value of find_consonants. Do not count
#any characters that are neither vowels nor consonants (e.g.
#punctuation, spaces, numbers).
#
#You may assume the string will be all lower-case letters
#(no capital letters).
