Ordinal:

#Python, like most languages, actually uses numbers in the 
#background to represent individual characters in a string. 
#For example, "a" is assigned the numeric value of 97. 
#We call this the ordinal value. www.asciitable.com shows
#a table of ordinal values: the ordinal value is listed in
#the 'dec' column, and the actual character is listed in
#'chr' column.
#
#You'll notice, though, that many of the characters here
#are weird. The first 31 are cryptic characters that have
#special meaning to the computer. The extended codes haven't
#really been used since Windows came along. Beyond these
#255, the higher numbers are actually used to represent
#emojis.
#
#Now, think about when you're asked to create a password.
#Typically, there are restrictions on what characters you
#can use. How do you check if a password is valid? You
#could have a list of valid characters and check each
#character against that list, but that would be a really
#long list. Instead, let's use ordinal values.
#
#Write a function called "valid_char" that determines
#if a single character (a string of length one) has an
#ordinal value corresponding to a valid character for a
#password. Valid characters are any character on the
#keyboard except spaces. Return True if it's a valid
#character, False if it is not.
#
#Hint: you can find the ordinal value of a character using 
#the built-in Python function ord(): ord("a") -> 97
#
#Hint 2: the range of legal characters will be one
#continuous range (e.g. characters 55 through 65, not
#separate ranges like 55 through 65 and 69 through 79).
#You can use asciitable.com to look up what range you
#should use.


#Write your function here!
def valid_char(a_string):
    for i in a_string:
        if ord(i) >= 33 and ord(i) <= 126:
            return True
    return False


#Below are some lines of code that will test your function.
#You can change the value of the variable(s) to test your
#function with different inputs.
#
#If your function works correctly, this will originally
#print: True, False, True, False

print(valid_char("a"))
print(valid_char(" "))
print(valid_char("!"))
print(valid_char("â˜º"))



ThirdChar:

#Write function called third_character that accepts a
#string as an argument and returns the third character
#of the string. If the user inputs a string with fewer than
#3 characters, return "Too short". 


#Write your function here!
def third_character(a_string):
    if len(a_string) < 3:
        return "Too short"
    return a_string[2]


#Below are some lines of code that will test your function.
#You can change the value of the variable(s) to test your
#function with different inputs.
#
#If your function works correctly, this will originally
#print: 1, o, and "Too short", each on a different line.
print(third_character("CS1301"))
print(third_character("Georgia Tech"))
print(third_character("GT"))



NumChange:

#Write a function called "num_changer" that accepts a string 
#of digits (0-9). You should make an integer from the digits 
#of the even indices and another number from the digits in 
#the odd indices. Return the sum of these two numbers. You 
#can assume the given string will have a length of at least 
#2 digits.
#
#For example, if the string was "123456", you would split
#this into two integers, 135 and 246. Adding them would give
#381. Or if the string was "13579", you would split this into
#159 and 37, then add them to get 196.
#
#Hint: You can do this with loops, but it's easier to do
#this with string slicing. Remember how we could pass a third
#argument to range() that would tell range how many numbers
#to skip? You can do something similar with string slices: if
#you include second colon in a string slice, the number
#that follows it lets you skip characters in the string. For
#example:
#
# "Hello, world!"[1:9] -> This gives "ello, wo".
# "Hello, world!"[1:9:2] -> This gives "el,w". Including :2
#    in the string slice skips every other letter. 
# "Hello, world!" [::3] -> This gives "Hl r!". Leaving the
#    first two spots blank tells it to look at the entire
#    string, but putting :3 at the end says to only take
#    every third character (H, l, space, r, and !).
#
#Hint 2: Remember, Python is zero-indexed. That means the
#first number in the string is at position 0, and so it goes
#in the even list.


#Write your function here!
def num_changer(StringOfDigits):
    TheEvens = int(StringOfDigits[::2])
    TheOdds = int(StringOfDigits[1::2])
    return TheEvens + TheOdds


#Below are some lines of code that will test your function.
#You can change the value of the variable(s) to test your
#function with different inputs.
#
#If your function works correctly, this will originally
#print: 123456 -> 381
string_int = "123456"
result = num_changer(string_int)
print(string_int + " -> " + str(result))



InParentheses:

#Write a function called "in_parentheses" that accepts a 
#single argument, a string representing a sentence that
#contains some words in parentheses. Your function should
#return the contents of the parentheses.
#
#For example:
#
# in_parentheses("This is a sentence (words!)") -> "words!"
#
#If no text appears in parentheses, return an empty string.
#Note that there are several edge cases introduced by this:
#all of the following function calls would return an empty
#string:
#
# in_parentheses("No parentheses")
# in_parentheses("Open ( only")
# in_parentheses("Closed ) only")
# in_parentheses("Closed ) before ( open")
#
#You may assume, however, that there will not be multiple
#open or closed parentheses.


#Write your function here!
def in_parentheses(a_string):
    openParentheses = a_string.find("(")
    closeParentheses = a_string.find(")")
    if openParentheses < closeParentheses and openParentheses != -1 and closeParentheses != -1:
        return a_string[openParentheses + 1: closeParentheses]
    return ""    


#Below are some lines of code that will test your function.
#You can change the value of the variable(s) to test your
#function with different inputs.
#
#If your function works correctly, this will originally
#print (including the blank lines):
#words!
#
#as he is doing right now
#
#
#!

print(in_parentheses("This is a sentence (words!)."))
print(in_parentheses("No parentheses here!"))
print(in_parentheses("David tends to use parentheses a lot (as he is doing right now). It tends to be quite annoying."))
print(in_parentheses("Open ( only"))
print(in_parentheses("Closed ) only"))
print(in_parentheses("Closed ) before ( open"))
print(in_parentheses("That's a lot of test cases(!)"))



StrType:

#Write a function called 'string_type' which accepts one
#string argument and determines what type of string it is. 
#
# - If the string is empty, return "empty".
# - If the string is a single character, return "character".
# - If the string represents a single word, return "word".
#   The string is a single word if it has no spaces.
# - If the string is a whole sentence, return "sentence".
#   The string is a sentence if it contains spaces, but
#   at most one period.
# - If the string is a paragraph, return "paragraph". The
#   string is a paragraph if it contains both spaces and
#   multiple periods (we won't worry about other
#   punctuation marks).
# - If the string is multiple paragraphs, return "page".
#   The string is a paragraph if it contains any newline
#   characters ("\n").
#
#Hint: think carefully about what order you should check
#these conditions in.
#
#Hint 2: remember, there exists a count() method that
#counts the number of times a string appears in another
#string. For example, "blah blah blah".count("blah")
#would return 3.


#Write your function here!
def string_type(a_string):
    if len(a_string) == 0:
        return "empty"
    elif "\n" in a_string:

InputType:

#Recall that input from a user is always in the form of a string. 
#Write a function called "input_type" that gets user input and 
#determines what kind of string the user entered. The user input
#will be supplied as an argument to the function like normal.
#
#  - Your function should return "integer" if the string only
#    contains characters 0-9.
#  - Your function should return "float" if the string only
#    contains the numbers 0-9 and at most one period.
#  - You should return "boolean" if the user enters "True" or
#    "False". 
#  - Otherwise, you should return "string".


#Write your function here!
def input_type(user_input):

QuoteThis:

#Write a function called "quote_this" that accepts two 
#strings as arguments: a string representing a quote and
#a string of a name. The function should return a new
#string with the quote surrounded by quotation marks (")
#followed by a dash and the given name. For example:
#
#a = quote_this("Try and fail, but never fail to try.",
#"Jared Leto")
#print(a) 
#
#Will print:
#"Try and fail, but never fail to try." -Jared Leto
#
#If the code were to continue, this:
#
#b = quote_this(a, "Michael Scott")
#print(b)
#
#Would print:
#""Try and fail, but never fail to try." -Jared Leto"

StringFinder:

#Write a function called string_finder. string_finder should
#take two parameters: a target string and a search string.
#The function will look for the search string within the
#target string.
#
#The function should return a string representing where in
#the target string the search string was found:
#
# - If search string is at the very beginning of target
#   string, then return "Beginning". For example:
#   string_finder("Georgia Tech", "Georgia") -> "Beginning"
#
# - If search string is at the very end of target string,
#   then return "End". For example:
#   string_finder("Georgia Tech", "Tech") -> "End"
#
# - If search string is in target string but not at the
#   very beginning or very end, then return "Middle. For
#   example:
#   string_finder("Georgia Tech", "gia") -> "Middle"
#
# - If search string is not in target string at all, then
#   return "Not found". For example:
#   string_finder("Georgia Tech", "Idaho") -> "Not found"
#
#Assume that we're only interested in the first instance
#of the search string if it appears multiple times in the
#target string, and that search string is definitely
#shorter than target string.
#
#Hint: Don't be surprised if you find that the "End" case
#is the toughest! You'll need to look at the lengths of
#both the target string and the search string.

#Write your function here!

FindColor:

#This one is a challenge. There's a lot going on: splitting
#up strings, removing unnecessary characters, converting to
#integers, and running a big conditional. Our solution to
#this is 34 lines -- you can do it!
#
#In web development, it is common to represent a color like 
#this:
#
#  rgb(red_val, green_val, blue_val)
#
#where red_val, green_val and blue_val would be substituted 
#with values from 0-255 telling the computer how much to 
#light up that portion of the pixel. For example:
#
# - rgb(255, 0, 0) would make a color red. 
# - rgb(255, 255, 0) would make yellow, because it is equal 
#   parts red and green. 
# - rgb(0, 0, 0) would make black, the absence of all color.
# - rgb(255, 255, 255) would make white, the presence of all
#   colors equally.
#
#Don't let the function-like syntax here confuse you: here,
#these are just strings. The string "rgb(0, 255, 0)"
#represents the color green.
#
#Write a function called "find_color" that accepts a single 
#argument expected to be a string as just described. Your
#function should return a simplified version of the color
#that is represented according to the following rules:
#
# If there is more red than any other color, return "red".
# If there is more green than any other color, return "green".
# If there is more blue than any other color, return "blue".
# If there are equal parts red and green, return "yellow".
# If there are equal parts red and blue, return "purple".
# If there are equal parts green and blue, return "teal".
# If there are equal parts red, green, and blue, return "gray".
# (even though this might be white or black).


#Write your function here!
def find_color(color):
    color = color.split(", ")
    color[0] = color[0].replace("rgb(", "")
    color[2] = color[2].replace(")", "")
    red = int(color[0])
    green = int(color[1])
    blue = int(color[2])
    if red > green and red > blue:
        return "red"
    elif green > red and green > blue:
        return "green"
    elif blue > red and blue > green:
        return "blue"
    elif red == green and red == blue:
        return "gray"
    elif red == green:
        return "yellow"
    elif red == blue:
        return "purple"
    elif green == blue:

Steps:

#Now, let's improve our steps() function to take one parameter
#that represents the number of 'steps' to print. It should
#then return a string that, when printed, shows output like
#the following:
#
#print(steps(3))
#111
#	222
#		333
#
#print(steps(6))
#111
#	222
#		333
#			444
#				555
#					666
#
#Specifically, it should start with 1, and show three of each
#number from 1 to the inputted value, each on a separate
#line. The first line should have no tabs in front, but each
#subsequent line should have one more tab than the line
#before it. You may assume that we will not call steps() with
#a value greater than 9.
#
#Hint: You'll want to use a loop, and you'll want to create
#the string you're building before the loop starts, then add
#to it with every iteration.


#Write your function here!
def steps(num_steps):
    a = ""
    for i in range(num_steps):
        a += "\t" * i + str(i + 1)* 3 + "\n"
    return a


#The following two lines will test your code, but are not
#required for grading, so feel free to modify them.
print(steps(3))
print(steps(6))



AfterSecond:

#Write a function called after_second that accepts two 
#arguments: a target string to search, and string to search
#for. The  function should return everything in the first
#string *after* the *second* occurrence of the search term.
#You can assume  there will always be at least two
#occurrences of the search term in the first string. 
#
#For example:
#  after_second("11223344554321", "3") -> 44554321
#
#The search term "3" appears at indices 4 and 5. So, this
#returns everything from the index 6 to the end.
#
#  after_second("heyyoheyhi!", "hey") -> hi!
#
#The search term "hey" appears at indices 0 and 5. The
#search term itself is three characters. So, this returns
#everything from the index 8 to the end.
#
#Hint: This may be more complicated than it looks! You'll
#have to look at the length of the search string and
#either modify the target string or take advantage of the
#extra arguments you can pass to find().


#Write your function here!
def after_second(target, search):
    position = target.find(search)
    add = len(search)
    secondOccurence = target.find(search, position + 1)

ReplaceAll:

#Write a function called "replace_all" that accepts three 
#arguments:
#
# - target_string, a string in which to search.
# - find_string, a string to search for.
# - replace_string, a string to use to replace every instance
#   of the value of find.
#
#The arguments will be provided in this order. Your function
#should mimic the behavior of "replace", but you cannot use
#that function in your implementation. Instead, you should
#find the result using a combination of split() and join(),
#or some other method.
#
#Hint: This exercise can be complicated, but it can also
#be done in a single short line of code! Think carefully about
#the methods we've covered.


#Write your function here!
def replace_all(target_string, find_string, replace_string):
    target_string = target_string.split(find_string)

#Below are some lines of code that will test your function.
#You can change the value of the variable(s) to test your
#function with different inputs.

SpongeBob:

#Write a function called mock. mock should take one
#parameter, a string. You may assume that the string will
#have only lowercase letters and spaces.
#
#Your function should return the same string, but any letter
#at an even index should be converted to uppercase.
#
#For example: mock("abcd efgh ijkl") would return
#"AbCd eFgH IjKl".
#
#Remember, you can use the ordinal function ord() to get the
#number associated with a single letter. For example,
#ord("a") returns 97. The number associated with lowercase
#letters is always 32 larger than the number associated with
#the equivalent uppercase letter. ord("a") is 97, and
#ord("A") is 65. ord("z") is 122, and ord("Z") is 90.
#
#Remember, you can use the character function chr() to
#convert a number back to a letter. For example, chr(65) will
#return "A".
#
#HINT: Treat all characters the same initially, then worry
#about taking care of spaces afterwards.


#Write your function here!
def mock(a_string):
    new_string = ""
